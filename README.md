# freeCodeCamp's Tribute Page 

So I've decided to start the fullstack path on the Odin Project. This lead me to the freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification wich presented me five web programming projects that I have to submit to earn my certification.

This one consists of a responsive tribute page containing some basic elements and a plain CSS stylesheet. Since I often try to make meaningful stuff, I've decided to pay tribute to Dinarco Reis aka The Red Lieutenant. One of the most obscure and underrated characters in Brazilian history.

This project is hosted [here](https://codepen.io/edesoares/full/KKmedzR).

Best regards,

Ã‰de.
