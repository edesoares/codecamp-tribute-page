        <h2>A brief timeline of Dinarco's life</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1904</strong> - Dinarco Reis was born in Rio de Janeiro city to a Piano Tuner and a Housewife. Leaves Rio in his early childhood to be raised by his aunt in Belo Horizonte due to his parent's divorce.</li>
          <li><strong>1918</strong> - At the age of 14, he supported himself as an electrician. Despite the difficulties, he managed to attend primary school.</li>
          <li><strong>1923</strong> - In his 19's he joined the Military Aviation School as a volunteer in Campo dos Afonsos. As a soldier he participated in the campaign against the 1924 Paulista Uprising, an attempt to overthrow the oligarch government and carry out a liberal policy.</li>
          <li><strong>1925</strong> - Was promoted to corporal and in the following year, as a third sergeant, he became a flight instructor and chief maintenance mechanic.</li>
          <li><strong>1930</strong> - With the outbreak of the 30's Revolution, Sergeant Dinarco hijacked a plane, taking it to Minas Gerais and joining the rebel forces that would eventually triumph.</li>
          <li><strong>1933</strong> - The first years after the revolution frustrated the expectations of many who were hoping to see a solution for the problems of the Brazilian people. Experience had taught the young officer that the path was not that of military coups conducted by a minority nor it was that of the anarchist exit. In 1933 Dinarco decided to join the Brazilian Communist Party.</li>
          <li><strong>1935</strong> - Along with many military men, Dinarco actively participated in the National Liberating Alliance. With an increase of state repression under Getúlio Vargas a communist uprising attempt was made in 1935 leaving at least 120 dead of the National Liberating Alliance.</li>
          <li><strong>1938</strong> - After being arrested for 17 months and made "dead" for legal effects, Dinarco was granted a limited amnesty but was never "resurrected" even until his death. He migrated to Rio Grande do Sul in seek for exile in Uruguay, but following a recommendation from the Communist Party, he volunteered alongside many countrymen to fight against fascism in the Spanish Civil War joining the Garibaldi Brigade, which stands out in the Battle of Ebro.</li>
          <li><strong>1942</strong> - He was sent, after the republican defeat in Spain, to a labour camp where he was forced to work in the construction of the Maginot Line with which France hoped to contain the Germans in the coming war. Dinarco managed to escape to Paris with some fellowmen where he joined the French Resistance to fight fascism once again. Eventually, he made his way back to Brazil in late 1942 with the arduous task of rebuilding the party. Then,  in the Mantiqueira Conference, he was elected to the party's Central Committee.</li>
          <li><strong>1946</strong> - With the end of both the war and the Vargas dictatorship, everything seemed to herald a phase of calm and democracy. But the emergence of the “cold war”, of which the Dutra government in Brazil was the characteristic representation, dashed hopes: the PCB was thrown into clandestinity and its parliamentary bench had its rights revoked.</li>
          <li><strong>1958</strong> - Despite the efforts to halt the influence of the Brazilian Communist Party, the Declaration of March 1958 defended by Dinarco, now in the Executive Committee, and many fellow partisans established the basis for many victories towards a more democratic society and greater support to well-needed reforms amongst the public.</li>
          <li><strong>1967</strong> - Another turnaround came in the form of a US backed Military Coup in 1964, when the communists became from illegal to persecuted. Two years after having organised the VI Congress of the Brazilian Communist Party in 1967, Dinarco exiled himself in an atempt to preserve part of the Central Commitee. Between 1973 and 1975 a third of the CC and  thousands of its militants were tortured and murdered by the military government.</li>
          <li><strong>1979</strong> - The slow and gradual democratic opening restored the legal status of the Communist Party and made possible Dinarco's return to brazilian lands in 1979.</li>
          <li><strong>1989</strong> - Dinarco Reis died in 1989 when he was still fully active, writing and giving lectures. He died without having been amnesty by the Air Force, which declared him dead since the 1935 Uprising. His amnesty was granted in 1989 only after his death.</li>            
        </ul>
        <p><i>"Having lived over his 80 years, through many arrests and exiles Dinarco continued to be the same coherent, lucid and capable fighter. He was not only a privileged witness to history: he was an active protagonist in his people's struggles for democracy, independence and progress towards socialism."</i></p>
